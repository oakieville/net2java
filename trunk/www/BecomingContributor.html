This page is for those of you who want to do more than just use
NET2Java technology. If you answer yes to one of the following
questions...<br>
<ul style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">
  <li>I want to add my translations back to the NET2Java library !</li>
  <li>I want to fix a bug in the NET2Java parser !</li>
  <li>I want to add some test cases to NET2Java !</li>
  <li>I want to add more sample applications rto NET2Java !</li>
  <li>I want to add a feature to NET2Java !</li>
</ul>
<br>
...then read on. Here's what I need you to do:-<br>
<br>
1) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Let's talk !</span> Drop me a
note: <span style="font-weight: bold;">danny dot coward at sun dot com</span>
and let me know what you'd like to check back in, and give me a little
background as to what you are using the technology for.<br>
<br>
2) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Let's share !</span>&nbsp; Next we
need to make sure that you are ok with sharing the ideas you are
contributing. So you need to fill out <a
 href="https://jdk.dev.java.net/Sun_Contributor_Agreement_v1.2.pdf">this
form</a>. I am not a lawyer, and if you are unsure about whether you or
the company you work for is ok with sharing the IP rights of those
ideas you may contribute, then you need to check with your own. Drop me
a note and I'll ask you to FAX a signed copy to a number I'm not going
to put on the internet :-)<br>
<br>
3) <span style="font-weight: bold;">House rules</span>&nbsp; If we get
this far, there are some house rules for being a committer, they are
simple. By being a committer you are agreeing to them, as follows.<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>If you do a checkin, you have to make sure all the tests continue
to run.</li>
  <li>If you add a feature or fix a bug, you must add a test case for
it.</li>
  <li>I'm all for those who do the work having a say in the future
direction of the technology, but I have the final say on contraversial
proposals or changes to the technology.</li>
  <li>I might have to revoke your contributor rights. If you break the
build, add features without tests, do anything against the goal of this
technology ("<span style="font-style: italic;">Together we can
translate every .NET application into Java !</span>"), are
unreasonable, unwilling to compromise, or are rude or unhelpful or
obnoxious to any member of the NET2Java community, or any of the other
irritating behaviors I've experienced in my working life, I'll probably
do so.</li>
  <li>Finally, these rules might change depending on how we all get
along.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
